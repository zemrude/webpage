      <h4> About me </h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">I am an experimental physicist specializing in particle astrophysics, in particular in neutrino astronomy. I work on the <a href="http://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube</a> experiment which is a neutrino telescope located at the South Pole.<br>
    IceCube is a particle detector at the South Pole that records the interactions of a nearly massless subatomic particle called the neutrino. IceCube searches for neutrinos from the most violent astrophysical sources: events like exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes and neutron stars.<br>
																						 If you are a student at ULB interested in talking about particle astrophysics and would like to know more about opportunities to work on IceCube and similar experiments, feel free to contact me.</p>
